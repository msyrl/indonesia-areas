## Indonesia Areas

In this repo, I was mapping data to JSON for personal usage.

What was I do:

- Execute script from `./src/wilayah.sql` in MySQL.
- Export data from MySQL to `wilayah.json` and put in `src` directory.
- Run `node index.js` to map and store the result to `data` directory.

Thank you to [cahyadsn](https://github.com/cahyadsn) for the data.
